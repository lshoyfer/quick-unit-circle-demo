Needed to demonstrate some concept about the Unit Circle to someone so I quickly cooked up this basic animation where the unit ray revolves around the circle with its y-component. Could've done this with Canvas API & requestAnimationFrame but wanted an excuse to try out PixiJS (& pixi-react), also tried out Bun 1.0.0 for the first time here, why not.
